       "\"\\n1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\\n\\nIn Excel, spreadsheets can have values of data types other than strings; \\ncells can have different fonts, sizes, or color settings; cells can have \\nvarying widths and heights; adjacent cells can be merged; and you can embed images and charts.\\n\\n2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\\n\\nYou pass a File object, obtained from a call to open().\\n\\n3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\\n\\nFile objects need to be opened in read-binary ('rb') for \\nreader objects and write-binary ('wb') for writer objects.\\n\\n4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?\\n\\nThe writerow() method\\n\\n5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?\\n\\nThe delimiter argument changes the string used to separate cells in a row. \\nThe lineterminator argument changes the string used to separate rows.\\n\\n\\n6.
